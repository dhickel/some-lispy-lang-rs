Small language experiment for messing around with while reading the crafting interpreters book. 
Originally started in java but ported to rust as something to focus on while learning the language.

Not much in it atm just basic cons list, arithmetic, conditions and a few built-in operations. I plan on adding classes/interfaces
and working on a bytecode interpreter for it as per part II of crafting interpreters. But either way nothing serious
just wanted a toy language for exploring concepts and learning.
